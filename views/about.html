<h1>About Me</h1>

  </br>

  <p> Hi, I'm Scott Reynolds. I used to sing and write tunes for a band called ALL, then a band called Goodbye Harry, 
  then a band called The Pavers, then a band called The Bonesaw Romance, then The Steaming Beast. 
  Now I'm just called Scott Reynolds, and I'm pretty ok all by myself. </p>
